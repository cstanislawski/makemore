# makemore

learning training models with karpathy's makemore - an autoregressive character-level language model for making more things

source repo:

<https://github.com/karpathy/makemore>

## methods

the repo contains a few methods for creating language models:

- bigram - [bigram.ipynb](bigram.ipynb) - a simple bigram model which looks at the previous character to predict the next based on probability distribution
- gradient descent - [gradient.ipynb](gradient.ipynb) - a simple gradient descent model which uses a one-layer neural network to predict the next character
